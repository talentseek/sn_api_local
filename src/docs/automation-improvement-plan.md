## Implementation Details

### Send Connections Scheduler
#### Rate Limiting and Batch Processing ‚úÖ
- Batch size: 5 profiles per batch
- Delays:
  - Between profiles: 5 seconds
  - Between batches: 5 seconds
  - Random delays added for natural behavior
- Daily limits:
  - Maximum 20 connections per campaign per day
  - Tracked in daily_connection_tracking table
  - Enforced before processing starts
- Safety measures:
  - Lock mechanism prevents overlapping runs
  - Configurable delays via connection_request_config
  - Random scrolling simulation
  - User agent spoofing
  - Error handling with automatic retries

#### Timezone Window Enforcement ‚úÖ
- Time windows (UK time):
  - Europe: 7:00-10:00
  - North America: 13:00-16:00
  - Asia: 00:00-04:00
- Implementation:
  - Hourly cron job checks all active campaigns
  - Each campaign checked against its timezone window
  - Campaigns outside their window are skipped
  - Random time selection within windows for natural behavior
- Safety measures:
  - Timezone validation on campaign creation
  - Logging of skipped campaigns
  - Clear window boundaries prevent overlap

#### Daily Limit Tracking ‚úÖ
- Database Structure:
  - Table: daily_connection_tracking
  - Fields: campaign_id, date, connections_sent, created_at, updated_at
  - Daily reset based on date field
- Implementation:
  - Default limit: 20 connections per campaign per day
  - Configurable per campaign via daily_connection_limit
  - Tracked independently for each campaign
- Enforcement:
  - Checked before processing starts
  - Updated after successful connections
  - Atomic updates prevent race conditions
- Safety measures:
  - Null handling for new days
  - Error handling for DB operations
  - Transaction support for updates
  - Logging of limit reached events

#### Resistance Detection and Cooldown ‚úÖ
- Database Structure:
  - Table: campaign_cooldowns
  - Fields: campaign_id, cooldown_until, created_at, updated_at
  - Unique constraint on campaign_id
- Implementation:
  - 2-hour cooldown period when LinkedIn resistance detected
  - Persistent cooldown tracking survives restarts
  - Automatic cooldown on LinkedIn-specific errors
- Safety measures:
  - Error logging with detailed messages
  - Graceful failure handling
  - Campaign-specific tracking
  - Automatic cleanup of expired cooldowns

#### Activity Logging ‚úÖ
- Implementation:
  - Tracks all message sending activities
  - Records success/failure counts
  - Stores message stage information
  - Captures error messages
  - Maintains daily limits tracking
- Metrics Tracked:
  - Total leads processed
  - Successful messages sent
  - Failed message attempts
  - Skipped (responded) leads
  - Remaining daily limits
- Safety Features:
  - Error handling for logging failures
  - Null value handling
  - Automatic status updates
  - Detailed error messages

## Phase 1: Connection Request Flow

### Send Connections Scheduler
- ‚úÖ Review rate limiting and batch processing
- ‚úÖ Verify timezone window enforcement
- ‚úÖ Validate daily limit tracking
- ‚úÖ Test resistance detection and cooldown
- ‚úÖ Ensure proper activity logging

### Check Connections Scheduler
- ‚úÖ Review profile selection logic
- ‚úÖ Verify 4-hour check interval
- ‚úÖ Test 7-day expiration handling
- ‚úÖ Validate batch processing
- ‚úÖ Check notification system

## Phase 2: Messaging Flow

### First Message (Stage 1) ‚úÖ
- Implementation:
  - Immediate sending on next scheduler run (hourly)
  - Picks up all newly connected leads:
    - Detected by connection_level = '1st'
    - No previous messages (message_sent = false)
    - No message stage (message_stage IS NULL)
  - No artificial delay check for stage 1
  - Timezone Windows:
    - Europe: 7:00-8:00, 8:00-9:00, 9:00-10:00
    - North America: 13:00-14:00, 14:00-15:00, 15:00-16:00
    - Asia: 00:00-1:00, 2:00-3:00, 3:00-4:00
    - Enforced at campaign level
    - Hourly checks within windows
  - Batch Processing:
    - Default batch size: 5 leads
    - Configurable via batchSize parameter
    - 5-second delay between batches
    - Consecutive failure detection (3 failures = stop)
    - Progress tracking per batch
  - Safety Features:
    - URL validation
    - Message content validation
    - Error handling
    - Status tracking

### First Message (Stage 1)
- ‚úÖ Verify immediate sending after connection acceptance
- ‚úÖ Update daily limit to 100 (safety limit only)
- ‚úÖ Review batch processing
- ‚úÖ Validate timezone windows

### Follow-up Message (Stage 2) ‚úÖ
- Implementation:
  - Sends follow-up messages to leads with message_stage = 1
  - Enforces 3-day calendar delay from last contact
  - Batch Processing:
    - Default batch size: 5 leads
    - 5-second delay between batches
    - Progress tracking and status updates
  - Safety Features:
    - Consecutive failure detection (3 failures = stop)
    - URL and message content validation
    - Error handling
    - Response checking
    - Lead status updates
  - Timezone Windows:
    - Same as Stage 1
    - Enforced at campaign level
    - Hourly checks within windows

### Follow-up Message (Stage 2)
- ‚úÖ Verify 3-day calendar delay
- ‚úÖ Update daily limit to 100 (safety limit only)

- ‚úÖ Validate skip logic for responded leads

### Final Follow-up (Stage 3)
- ‚è≥ Verify 3-day calendar delay
- ‚úÖ Update daily limit to 100 (safety limit only)

  - Status (success/failure)
  - Counts and metrics
  - Error details (when applicable)
  - Timestamp and timezone
- ‚úÖ Implement consistent error formatting
- ‚úÖ Add progress tracking for long-running operations
